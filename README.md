## Little Story
After developing Aplu, one of the former store managers asked if it would be possible to create something to facilitate the work method of checking the expiration date of products.

## Objetive
The purpose of the application is to have a better control of the expiration dates of the products.

## My Approach
Since the application is part of the same company that I developed Aplu, I decided to use the same UI again to give it a special touch.

The application consists of having a better control of expiration dates, since the current method was not effective.

As a database, in this case I used googlesheet, since it is something that can be used in double cases.
In this case, the application will fetch the dates defined in the application and show them to the user.

I also added more functions to make the experience easier compared to the previous method they used.
